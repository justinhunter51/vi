Analyzing Real Estate Permit Data in Detroit

### Motivation

As a Detroit Native I have long been interested in the cities real estate.
Recently the city has been experiencing a reniessance and the downtown core has rebounded significantly since bankrupcy in 2013.
Yet the city still has a huge population loss and many of the institutions that are failing.

### Background information

### Summary 

The city seems to be doing much better in a number of key areas including:
  - Acceration of destruction of abandoned home.
  - Adding new cell towers to improve cell service.

The city also seems to be struggling in a number of key areas including:
  - New housing starts are still lagging many more established cities
  - Retail permitting continues to lag (Especially a problem considering much of the city is in foot dessert).
